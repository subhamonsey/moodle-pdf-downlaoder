# Moodle PDF Downloader ðŸš€

This is a Python script that logs into a Moodle course page and downloads all available PDF files. If your college uses moodle as their coursepage and you often find yourself wanting to download all the pdfs from a course but hate doing it manually. Try this out. 

## Here is a step by step guide: ðŸ“ƒ

### Windows
1. Download the `.exe` and `.bat` file only.
2. Double click the `.bat` file
3. Provide the link to the login screen and the course.
### Linux 
- Run `./download_moodle_pdfs --login-url [LOGIN-URL] --course-url [COURSE-URL]`

### If you don't trust me
- Install python
- Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `python download_moodle_pdfs.py --login-url [LOGIN-URL] --course-url [COURSE-URL]`

The files get downloaded to the directory from where you are running the script.
